   - Run vanilla version, compiled as per the compile script (no compiler
     optimization) and list: Vanilla (no compiler opt) FPS = 
     
   - Run your optimized code, compiled without compiler optimization
     and list: Your Code (no compiler opt) FPS =

   - Run vanilla code compiled with flag -O3 for compiler optimization
     and list: Vanilla (compiler optimized) FPS =
     
   - Run your optimized code, compiled with flag -O3
     and list: Your Code (compiler optimized) FPS =
     
     What is the ratio of your code (compiler optimized) to vanilla
     with no compiler optimization?
     
     Ratio = Vanilla(no compiler opt) FPS / Your code(compiler optimized) FPS
           =
     
a) Look at the profiler output for vanilla_imageRescale(). Identify the
   lines that you think are un-necessary bottlenecks (i.e. lines whose
   CPU usage can be reduced or eliminated by careful coding).

   List these bottleneck lines in descending order (i.e. the ones that
   consume most time at the top) of CPU time. Please list
	- The actual line of code
	- The amount of time taken
	(you can copy/paste from the profiler output)

   1. getPixel(src,floor(fx),floor(fy),src_x,&R1,&G1,&B1); (Ir 1.55+0.7+3.94)
   The line creates a bottleneck since it takes 1.55 instructions for casting floor output from double to int as the function requires,
   and 0.7 for both floor calls, then 3.94 for the actual function execution which does a complex set of calculations to the image pointer before
   assigning R, G, and B from memory. This is true for all 4 times it is called.

   2. setPixel(dst,x,y,dest_x,R,G,B); (Ir 0.84+4.08)
   This line takes 4.08 instructions to actually execute 3 writes to memory, then 0.84 instructions outside of the function call. I imagine the 0.84 instructions
   aren't actual computations, but rather cache misses as almost all arguments have not been accessed for a while. setPixel also does the same thing as getPixel from a
   performance standpoint, although some extra time might be due to the fact that this is the first time these specific bytes in dst are being written to

   3. RT1=(dx*R2)+(1-dx)*R1; (Ir 1.12)
   I think that majority of the time for this line is used for the implicit cast from unsigned char to double (R1 and R2). The reason I
   think this line is improvable is that (1-dx) can be done beforehand and stored once (as this line is repeated 8 times). 

   4. R=(unsigned char)((dy*RT2)+((1-dy)*RT1)); (Ir 0.63)
   This line has to first do some double multiplication and addition, then a cast from double to unsigned char. Since casting is expensive, I think that the
   cost of this line is split between the cast and computations.

   For each line, explain why the line creates a bottleneck (in terms
   of what you know about CPU architecture). I want specific reasons
   why a line you listed takes a large chunk of CPU time.

b) For each of the lines in a)

   Describe what you did in fast_imageRescale() to reduce/resolve the
   problem.

   Explain why your improvement should work (again, based on what you
   know about CPU architecture).

c) List any other optimizations you performed in your code and why they
   help increase speed

d) Is there any part of the vanilla code that could not be optimized
   at all? if so, which?
   
e) Now run your code with cache sim on. Identify the lines that you see
   causing cache misses, and for each of these please list:
   
    - The line of code
    - The number of cache misses it caused
    (you can copy/paste from the profiler output)
    
   Describe any strategy you can come up with that may help reduce these
   cache misses.

f) Do you think you have achieved close to optimal performance on this
   code? (yes/no)

g) If your answer to d) is no, what could you do to further increase
   performance?
